	<h2 class="page-title"> The Release Technique </h1>
	
	<p> The Release technique has basically developed to a collective spirit within the dance community. It can be summarized mostly as a somatic approach, 
	which means that the emphasis is on the internal physical sensation of the dancer. This is where the biggest contrast lies to more classical techniques like ballet, 
	where the aesthetics and the outside appearance of the body and the movement is most important.
	It is kind of an introspective approach where the dancers awareness is aimed 
	towards the state of mind he puts himself in during the dance. The movements can influence this state of mind, which in return influences what kind of choices the dancer will make in his actions. 
	This may sound very obvious but before that the internal struggle of the dancer was much less present on stage. <br>
	
	The technique was given its name by Joan Skinner, who named it SRT (Skinner Releasing Technique). Before her many other dancers contributed to the material and ideas that exist around it though. 
	Skinner used external stimuli like music or voices to to fuel the dancers imagination. Words are also used to create imagery for movement. 
	
	From the beginning it has also been used as a therapy like many other somatic techniques. Since its conception in the 1970s it has been one of the main influences in contemporary dance. 
	It is hard to imagine a contemporary dance perfomance nowadays that does not relate in any way to the releasing technique, with the exception of maybe a Bboy competetion.

	What are the main principles of the Release technique? <br></p>
	
	<ul>
	<li> A use of images (concepts or ideas of physical actions) that can produce new movement patterns. For example an animal-like movement can be created by picturing this animal and its style of motion. </li>
	<li> An awareness for weight, which is represented by the forces that go through the body.</li>
	<li> The alignment of the limb and the bones in the body. Movement is supposed to be started by the muscles closest to the center.</li>
	<li> The Search for an Understanding of the human anatomy to apply the internal images.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> An example that contains some of these points: <p>

	<p> In the video Brendan is pausing multiple times, seemingly using the time to imagine a new picture that will inspire his next move. He also uses the bench as a support for his weight in a natural way. 
	Unfortunately the video effects make the movements a bit hard to follow. </p>
	
	<h2 class="page-heading"> How can we use the Release technique as jugglers? </h2>
	
	<p> Trying to apply the technique to juggling brings several opportunities and difficulties in my opinion. The fact that we use objects kind of limits the imagination that is possible. 
	Say we picture the movement of a tiger, there are still juggling balls in our hands which makes for an odd tiger. However we can use different kind of imagery to fuel our creativity. Think about the relationship between juggler and his object. 
	He could be careless about them and damage them. Or he falls victim and blames them for his drops. The third alternative could be a caring friend who goes back and forth with his props.<br></p>

	<p> Michael probably performed his 3 ball routine more often than he can remember, but his surprise when the ball bounces away from him in the beginning looks genuine. After all the hours of practice he still has a connection to his prop.<br> 

	The weight of the props is also a fact that is usually neglected but can be used to create a story. When juggling always looks light and effortless, of course the difficulty of the tricks is not felt by an onlooker. Only 
	certain extras like eating an apple or juggling chainsaws can then reinstall the sense of effort or risk. However this not necessary if the weight of the objects have a visible effect on the juggling and the jugglers movement.</p><br>
	 	
	See how much harder for the juggler in the video it is to keep his posture the more clubs he collects in his hands. That makes the accomplishment of the flash just way more noticable.</p>
